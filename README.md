## Note

### Tailwind Configuration Files

#### The `tailwind.config.dev.js` File

---

The `tailwind.config.dev.js` file serves as a placeholder file for developers. Its purpose is to simplify the configuration process of `tailwindcss`.
Within this file, you will find various CSS objects that can be customized and configured based on your specific needs. Feel free to add your own properties and tweak the configurations according to your project requirements.

#### The `tailwind.config.js` File

---

The `tailwind.config.js` file is where the actual configuration for `tailwindcss` resides. It is the primary file where you can make modifications to Tailwind's default configuration.
By referencing and importing the CSS objects defined in the `tailwind.config.dev.js` file, you can easily customize and extend the configuration of Tailwind CSS.

Please note that the `tailwind.config.dev.js` file is not required for the functionality of `tailwindcss`, but it serves as a convenient tool to streamline the configuration process for developers.
